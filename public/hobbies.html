    <p><h2>My hobbies include: </h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Record Collecting</h3>
            <p>I love music in general, so what better way to listen to music than with something you
                can hold in your hands? My uncle got me into records when i was 16 and since then i've built
                a collecion of almost 200 records. Although my collection is primarily hip-hop, I love all music
                and have a passion for listeng to new music on vinyl.

        <li><h3>Circuit Projects</h3>
            <img src="../images/arduino.jpeg" alt="Arduino" width="400">
            <p>I discovered Arduino in my second year of university, and I instantly fell in love with the fun I was
            having making projects. As a computer science major, it was super easy to learn how to program and use
            the Arduino, which was a head start. Developing projects has become one of my favourite activities, and i've
            learned to make things like a weather station, a smart mirror, and a smart home system. I love the feeling of
            creating something from scratch and seeing it work in real life.
